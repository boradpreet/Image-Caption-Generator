* An Image to Text Generator is an artificial intelligence system that takes an image as input and generates a descriptive sentence or caption that explains the content of the image in natural language. This technology is powered by advanced deep learning models that combine computer vision and natural language processing. The visual understanding part uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) to analyze the objects, people, actions, and scenes in the image. Then, a language model—typically based on Transformers—generates a coherent and meaningful textual description. These systems are widely used in applications such as helping visually impaired users understand visual content, automating image tagging, content creation, surveillance, and digital marketing. One popular model for this task is BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining), which is trained on large image-caption datasets to accurately describe images in human-like language.
